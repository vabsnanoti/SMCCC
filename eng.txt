1169	Please take strict action to control corona in Mumbai lockdown is extended but people are still on road if u can stop people we can control and win over corona and also look into that weather every one is getting the benefits given by govt ..lot of people are suffering of hunger please try to provide them rations
1170	Sir government should buy vegetables from farmers directly and in whichever district they are buying should distribute in trucks at door steps rather than selling through local vendors to avoid crowds. Local MLAs should be given guidelines by government on this. Lets not allow farmers efforts to get wasted 
1172	Alot of people are losing their jobs. Companies are sacking people... and alot of people haven't recvd salaries.... this is another issue that also needs addressing. Thank you sir. You are managing it extremely well. Respect. 
1174	 Please open Wine shops so that black marketing of liquor is stopped.
1180	We are lucky having cm and pm nice and caring
1181	"Sir, its a humble request to please see to it that many employes have not yet got salary for march month...And our organization is one of that, on asking we are getting reply that after lockdown get over we will see for salary."
1184	"Some Questions to be answered -   1. If there is a crowd of laborers going home, why do none of them have bags ?  2. The lockdown till April 30 in Maharashtra was already announced, so why the commotion happening today? 3. Is it people don't take CM's announcement seriously and believe in PM's announcement more.  :confused_face::confused_face:"
1185	No other OPTION... Army should be called in Mumbai to control the situation as Mumbai cases are the highest
1189	"Very empathetic address by CM like a true leader who cares! Discussing the action plans with public is very reassuring thing to do.:thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:  21,000 ppl volunteered to become Covid19 warriors on CM's call ..makes me so proud of my state.:heart_suit::heart_suit::heart_suit::heart_suit:"
1190	"What happened today at Bandra is very upsetting, like this Mumbai will never will able to control the spreading of virus,even if  the lockdown is extended for 2 months and even the gathering for food is not helping in social distancing "
1193	"Sir,  i tried reaching Mr.  Rajesh Tope our health Minister. But couldn't reach him.   We have airocide( kind of air purification system) machines which can kill all viruses in closed environment and can fix in isolation wards to protect Covid -19 patients.  This will complete protection and pure air in specific installed area. Most useful for all hospitals.  Pls arrange to connect me from any health department offcials.  Pls"
1194	Good answer sr ty I request all people plzz stay in home if any problem contact government departments....chief minister sr ne hindi main samjhadiya..are mumbai main rhkr paisa kamaye aur aaj musibat aayi to gaon bhag rahe ho ..aur jb situation thik hogi to vapas aaoge .

1205	Sir  we middle class also has families even we are humans. There is no job security for us we are totally dependent on our jobs no one is addressing nor looking into it. Banks given wave off in EMI for 2 months but its impact is huge in our life’s. Our salary comes deduction of tax again for everything we are forced to pay more taxes on everything.

I see there is lots of black sales of alcohol and encouragement for illegal sales. You can give some guidance on the sale and can control while selling alcohol additional taxes can be applicable it can add additional benefits to government and can help many people who needs.. I am sure if you even sale for additional 25% tax then also people will buy its sad reality that alcohol is been sold out unofficially at 5 times extra charge... Kindly think about the best possible... Lots of best wishes for future Sir. Together we win against this :folded_hands:

If maharashtra govt not able to handle such crisis they have to resign they cant blame central govt for everything. Increase number of deaths too most in maharashtra and cases are increasing rapidly too. Udhav thackrey not have experience  to handle such situation.

1673	It seems it was preplanned.
1674	"Respected CM sir, appreciate that you taken great steps in increasing testing and tracing. But it is high time to request for paramilitary in certain areas in Maharashtra, specially in Mumbai. If such instances continue in future, there can be a significant rise in the number of cases. Also we need to enhance testing further, implement pool testing in cold spots. Early detection and mass testing is the key to flatten the curve. We should look into home delivery models for essentials in order to stop crowding. If migrant laborers want to go home, this must be coordinated with the native states if the migrant laborers and transport must be arranged accordingly. Native states must strictly quarantine everyone"

Also, you are urging the businessmen to show sympathy towards the needful employees and pay them. Just to understand, what are you thinking about the Business OWNERS? Since the closure has been announced, the businesses are on a total standstill. How will they survive?  SALARIES - ON Rent On, ELECTRICITY BILL - ON TAXATION - ON BANK INTEREST - ON GST - ON.  EMI  - ON   There is no relief for us. We don’t mind sitting at our home , only if these expenses are cut off. The government is not ready to compromise on any front with this regard & just expecting the business houses to bear the expenses with there shut businesses. Is this really fair?

Try to monitor the activities where this poor migrant living / accommodation / shelters home ( by the government )right now- ask them whether they are getting sufficient food and basic amenities  2.

In Maharashtra the majority of marathi speaking is more, think about those people who live in villages, so CM will adress in marathi only, and obviously he will not adress people in all language. What can be done is, if possible subtitles can be given into hindi. I myself ffrom bihar, I understand marathi but people who don't know marathi for them make subtitles of hindi.

3147	"We lost our beloved freedom fighter grandfather ar Sason hospital pune because of missmanagamet and lack of basic care.  Our Freedom fighter Grandfather was admitted at Sason Hospital for Corona Testing ward.   We ourselves lifted him and put him on the Testing ward bed because of no ward boy.  Here lot the beds were kept at a distance of 1 feet only.  There we no masks on suspected patients. Some patients we waiting for test  report from more than 3 days. So if a person is not having corona he will definitely get it from a possitive person coughing.  Our grandfather had phenomia. But as no private hospital was getting him admitted before corona test we had to take him to sason.  His test result came negative. But before test result he lost his precious life.  They had removed his oxygen mask and saline also earlier only because he was moving his hands. They should have done something so atleast oxygen was given to him untill test result came.  There protocal is before corona test result no medicice will be given. This we felt is not right.  We feel People who are very serious should be given proper medicinal attention till the test results come.  Other wise deaths from non corona patients will be more.  Some of the observations we made at Sason hospital corona testing ward.  1. Lots of beds are kept at 30-60cm distance.  2. Many patients are not wearing masks and coughing.  3. Just to take out case paper in order to admit ptient to the testing ward half an hour to 45 minutes waiting time is needed.   Till then our Grandfather was kept in a waiting ward where all corona suspects were standing in front of us. He was not even given basic something to cover himself as he was feeling very cold.  So you better take a pillow and bed sheet with you.  4. Inside the testing ward also the bedsheet of the earlier patient is not removed. So one might very well sleep on the positive patients bedsheet.  5. In the testing wards nurses stand at the door and ask if any one wants food. If your  patient us able to walk well and good. If not you might die of hunger and water. So you better carry food and water and go your self in the testing ward to give it to them in case your patient cant has difficuly in walking.  6. If your patient is not in walking condition and wants to go to toilet. They wont get help from hospital staff. So you have to fight with army at the door of the ward to let you inside to check your patient. Sugeastion: you better take adult daiper for such patients and your self put and remove them.  7. If your patient needs continous attention in case of very serious situation. You will have to stand or sit on your pateints bed 24x7 till result if test come. So in case your patient need help you can tell the doctor.  We have seen all of these. Our Grandfather Freedomfighter Shankarrao Ramchandra Jagdale was a great soul, who did a lot for his country while he was alive and even till his last breadth.  Due to weakness he was not able to talk and move himself at the time of admission on 7th April. Being an Isolation wards we to could not help much.   I think he found himself helpless and dependent at that movement and left this world to serve at Heaven much before we received the Negative report for his Covid19 test. He never wanted to be dependent on anyone and lived his life with Values and Principles. And was doing all his activities independently till 6th April 2020. He always acted like a Warrior in every situation and truly lived his life like a King till his last Breath. As per his mission statement, he left his life for saving the Nation.  He understood that if he is moved to any private hospital after testing negative for Covid19 test this time, still he would carry great chances of affecting others due to the unsafe conditions in the Suspect ward. A great Salute and let’s pay tribute to the Real Freedom Fighter who didn’t only fought before independence but continued his fight till last breath.  I am sure our Nation would not forget the services rendered by this silent ‘Hero’.  He is now settled permanently in our Hearts...  From all Jagdale Family.."

3363	Please speak in national language 
3372	If in case the lock down extends beyond 3may then make plan and arrangement to send back the migrant labour who have finished 15 days of quarantine back to their hometown bcoz keeping people in camps is more dangerous and can spread covid19 faster than anything. The ones who don't want to go back give them jobs as delivery people or employ in grocery chains etc or in place of volunteers. ALSO most important is to start testing building and flat wise so that in the true sense the identification isolation and treatment will be done.And please make testing free or at very nominal rate. .so that everybody has access to it.rs 5000 and rs 1500 per person is too expensive for a family to get tested so no point of lock down. And please stop depositing cash and free food to people who are getting their salary and use these funds instead to  provide free testing for all .
3379	"Darshan writes..  Today at 11:43 am ABP News (Marathi) printed a news with the headlines:  Due to Lockdown Special Trains Are Being Launched for Stranded Migrants.  The news is in Marathi but I am posting the link here if anyone is interested.  https://marathi.abplive.com/…/railway-to-run-jansadharan-sp…  The report, goes on in great detail on how special trains will be launched and the stranded migrants in Mumbai will be taken to their villages. As usual they are quoting ""sources"" and a letter sent by some Dy. manager in south central railways proposing this.  End result.......1000s of poor migrant workers in Mumbai flock to Bandra Station because they think the trains have already started, though the ABP news does not say it's started NOW.  Was it really important for ABP News to post such a hurried report in such an irresponsible manner?  I don't know, maybe they will come back and say that the people should have gone beyond headlines and read the full article.  But the fact remains that in today's times, responsible journalism is hard to find.  Disclaimer: No Trains or Buses have started for anyone across India. Migrants are supposed to hold their positions. Govt will take care of you. And listen to only what the STATE LEADERS say themselves, don't fall prey to these idiotic TRP hungry media rumors.  *****  Please revoke their license . They must be punished !!

3793	"On ground level the conditions is very bad. We lost our beloved freedom fighter grandfather ar Sason hospital pune because of missmanagamet and lack of basic care.  Our Freedom fighter Grandfather was admitted at Sason Hospital for Corona Testing ward.   We ourselves lifted him and put him on the Testing ward bed because of no ward boy.  Here lot the beds were kept at a distance of 1 feet only.  There we no masks on suspected patients. Some patients we waiting for test  report from more than 3 days. So if a person is not having corona he will definitely get it from a possitive person coughing.  Our grandfather had phenomia. But as no private hospital was getting him admitted before corona test we had to take him to sason.  His test result came negative. But before test result he lost his precious life.  They had removed his oxygen mask and saline also earlier only because he was moving his hands. They should have done something so atleast oxygen was given to him untill test result came.  There protocal is before corona test result no medicice will be given. This we felt is not right.  We feel People who are very serious should be given proper medicinal attention till the test results come.  Other wise deaths from non corona patients will be more.  Some of the observations we made at Sason hospital corona testing ward.  1. Lots of beds are kept at 30-60cm distance.  2. Many patients are not wearing masks and coughing.  3. Just to take out case paper in order to admit ptient to the testing ward half an hour to 45 minutes waiting time is needed.   Till then our Grandfather was kept in a waiting ward where all corona suspects were standing in front of us. He was not even given basic something to cover himself as he was feeling very cold.  So you better take a pillow and bed sheet with you.  4. Inside the testing ward also the bedsheet of the earlier patient is not removed. So one might very well sleep on the positive patients bedsheet.  5. In the testing wards nurses stand at the door and ask if any one wants food. If your  patient us able to walk well and good. If not you might die of hunger and water. So you better carry food and water and go your self in the testing ward to give it to them in case your patient cant has difficuly in walking.  6. If your patient is not in walking condition and wants to go to toilet. They wont get help from hospital staff. So you have to fight with army at the door of the ward to let you inside to check your patient. Sugeastion: you better take adult daiper for such patients and your self put and remove them.  7. If your patient needs continous attention in case of very serious situation. You will have to stand or sit on your pateints bed 24x7 till result if test come. So in case your patient need help you can tell the doctor.  We have seen all of these. Our Grandfather Freedomfighter Shankarrao Ramchandra Jagdale was a great soul, who did a lot for his country while he was alive and even till his last breadth.  Due to weakness he was not able to talk and move himself at the time of admission on 7th April. Being an Isolation wards we to could not help much.   I think he found himself helpless and dependent at that movement and left this world to serve at Heaven much before we received the Negative report for his Covid19 test. He never wanted to be dependent on anyone and lived his life with Values and Principles. And was doing all his activities independently till 6th April 2020. He always acted like a Warrior in every situation and truly lived his life like a King till his last Breath. As per his mission statement, he left his life for saving the Nation.  He understood that if he is moved to any private hospital after testing negative for Covid19 test this time, still he would carry great chances of affecting others due to the unsafe conditions in the Suspect ward. A great Salute and let’s pay tribute to the Real Freedom Fighter who didn’t only fought before independence but continued his fight till last breath.  I am sure our Nation would not forget the services rendered by this silent ‘Hero’.  He is now settled permanently in our Hearts...  From all Jagdale Family.."

5235	Sir government should buy vegetables from farmers directly and in whichever district they are buying should distribute in trucks at door steps rather than selling through local vendors to avoid crowds. Local MLAs should be given guidelines by government on this. Lets not allow farmers efforts to get wasted 
5237	Alot of people are losing their jobs. Companies are sacking people... and alot of people haven't recvd salaries.... this is another issue that also needs addressing. Thank you sir. You are managing it extremely well. Respect. 
5239	 Please open Wine shops so that black marketing of liquor is stopped.

5249	"Some Questions to be answered -   1. If there is a crowd of laborers going home, why do none of them have bags ?  2. The lockdown till April 30 in Maharashtra was already announced, so why the commotion happening today? 3. Is it people don't take CM's announcement seriously and believe in PM's announcement more.  :confused_face::confused_face:"
5250	No other OPTION... Army should be called in Mumbai to control the situation as Mumbai cases are the highest
5254	"Very empathetic address by CM like a true leader who cares! Discussing the action plans with public is very reassuring thing to do.:thumbs_up_light_skin_tone:  21,000 ppl volunteered to become Covid19 warriors on CM's call ..makes me so proud of my state.:heart_suit::heart_suit::heart_suit::heart_suit:"

5258	"Sir,  i tried reaching Mr.  Rajesh Tope our health Minister. But couldn't reach him.

5463	Indian Government should make Stringent immigration laws- this time it’s a public health emergency that’s shaking up the world economy. Goverment must make strict immigration process to prevent further propagation of the infection. International boarders should be kept closed post corona for atleast 6months. Only medical and official government travels should be allowed. Leisure group travels should be completely banned for a year. As the virus entered india via international travellers.

I see there is lots of black sales of alcohol and encouragement for illegal sales. You can give some guidance on the sale and can control while selling alcohol additional taxes can be applicable it can add additional benefits to government and can help many people who needs.. I am sure if you even sale for additional 25% tax then also people will buy its sad reality that alcohol is been sold out unofficially at 5 times extra charge... Kindly think about the best possible... Lots of best wishes for future Sir. Together we win against this :folded_hands:

Increase number of deaths too most in maharashtra and cases are increasing rapidly too. Udhav thackrey not have experience  to handle such situation.

5740	"Respected CM sir, appreciate that you taken great steps in increasing testing and tracing. But it is high time to request for paramilitary in certain areas in Maharashtra, specially in Mumbai. If such instances continue in future, there can be a significant rise in the number of cases. Also we need to enhance testing further, implement pool testing in cold spots. Early detection and mass testing is the key to flatten the curve. We should look into home delivery models for essentials in order to stop crowding. If migrant laborers want to go home, this must be coordinated with the native states if the migrant laborers and transport must be arranged accordingly. Native states must strictly quarantine everyone"

You may go to Southern Indian states and check how much importance is given to Hindi over their native language!  If you live in Maharashtra, live on Maharashtra's terms, don't try to be a liberal! जय शिवराय!"

Also, you are urging the businessmen to show sympathy towards the needful employees and pay them. Just to understand, what are you thinking about the Business OWNERS? Since the closure has been announced, the businesses are on a total standstill. How will they survive?  SALARIES - ON Rent On, ELECTRICITY BILL - ON TAXATION - ON BANK INTEREST - ON GST - ON.  EMI  - ON   There is no relief for us. We don’t mind sitting at our home , only if these expenses are cut off. The government is not ready to compromise on any front with this regard & just expecting the business houses to bear the expenses with there shut businesses. Is this really fair?

You have to understand their perspective reason for this...  To resolve this -   1. Try to monitor the activities where this poor migrant living / accommodation / shelters home ( by the government )right now- ask them whether they are getting sufficient food and basic amenities  2. Try to motivate them by giving monetary factors ( this can be discussed with them face to face)  3.

In Maharashtra the majority of marathi speaking is more, think about those people who live in villages, so CM will adress in marathi only, and obviously he will not adress people in all language. What can be done is, if possible subtitles can be given into hindi. I myself ffrom bihar, I understand marathi but people who don't know marathi for them make subtitles of hindi.

7249	"We lost our beloved freedom fighter grandfather ar Sason hospital pune because of missmanagamet and lack of basic care.  Our Freedom fighter Grandfather was admitted at Sason Hospital for Corona Testing ward.   We ourselves lifted him and put him on the Testing ward bed because of no ward boy.  Here lot the beds were kept at a distance of 1 feet only.  There we no masks on suspected patients. Some patients we waiting for test  report from more than 3 days. So if a person is not having corona he will definitely get it from a possitive person coughing.  Our grandfather had phenomia. But as no private hospital was getting him admitted before corona test we had to take him to sason.  His test result came negative. But before test result he lost his precious life.  They had removed his oxygen mask and saline also earlier only because he was moving his hands. They should have done something so atleast oxygen was given to him untill test result came.  There protocal is before corona test result no medicice will be given. This we felt is not right.  We feel People who are very serious should be given proper medicinal attention till the test results come.  Other wise deaths from non corona patients will be more.  Some of the observations we made at Sason hospital corona testing ward.  1. Lots of beds are kept at 30-60cm distance.  2. Many patients are not wearing masks and coughing.  3. Just to take out case paper in order to admit ptient to the testing ward half an hour to 45 minutes waiting time is needed.   Till then our Grandfather was kept in a waiting ward where all corona suspects were standing in front of us. He was not even given basic something to cover himself as he was feeling very cold.  So you better take a pillow and bed sheet with you.  4. Inside the testing ward also the bedsheet of the earlier patient is not removed. So one might very well sleep on the positive patients bedsheet.  5. In the testing wards nurses stand at the door and ask if any one wants food. If your  patient us able to walk well and good. If not you might die of hunger and water. So you better carry food and water and go your self in the testing ward to give it to them in case your patient cant has difficuly in walking.  6. If your patient is not in walking condition and wants to go to toilet. They wont get help from hospital staff. So you have to fight with army at the door of the ward to let you inside to check your patient. Sugeastion: you better take adult daiper for such patients and your self put and remove them.  7. If your patient needs continous attention in case of very serious situation. You will have to stand or sit on your pateints bed 24x7 till result if test come. So in case your patient need help you can tell the doctor.  We have seen all of these. Our Grandfather Freedomfighter Shankarrao Ramchandra Jagdale was a great soul, who did a lot for his country while he was alive and even till his last breadth.  Due to weakness he was not able to talk and move himself at the time of admission on 7th April. Being an Isolation wards we to could not help much.   I think he found himself helpless and dependent at that movement and left this world to serve at Heaven much before we received the Negative report for his Covid19 test. He never wanted to be dependent on anyone and lived his life with Values and Principles. And was doing all his activities independently till 6th April 2020. He always acted like a Warrior in every situation and truly lived his life like a King till his last Breath. As per his mission statement, he left his life for saving the Nation.  He understood that if he is moved to any private hospital after testing negative for Covid19 test this time, still he would carry great chances of affecting others due to the unsafe conditions in the Suspect ward. A great Salute and let’s pay tribute to the Real Freedom Fighter who didn’t only fought before independence but continued his fight till last breath.  I am sure our Nation would not forget the services rendered by this silent ‘Hero’.  He is now settled permanently in our Hearts...  From all Jagdale Family.."

7475	If in case the lock down extends beyond 3may then make plan and arrangement to send back the migrant labour who have finished 15 days of quarantine back to their hometown bcoz keeping people in camps is more dangerous and can spread covid19 faster than anything. The ones who don't want to go back give them jobs as delivery people or employ in grocery chains etc or in place of volunteers. ALSO most important is to start testing building and flat wise so that in the true sense the identification isolation and treatment will be done.And please make testing free or at very nominal rate. .so that everybody has access to it.rs 5000 and rs 1500 per person is too expensive for a family to get tested so no point of lock down. And please stop depositing cash and free food to people who are getting their salary and use these funds instead to  provide free testing for all .
7482	"Darshan writes..  Today at 11:43 am ABP News (Marathi) printed a news with the headlines:  Due to Lockdown Special Trains Are Being Launched for Stranded Migrants.  The news is in Marathi but I am posting the link here if anyone is interested.  https://marathi.abplive.com/…/railway-to-run-jansadharan-sp…  The report, goes on in great detail on how special trains will be launched and the stranded migrants in Mumbai will be taken to their villages. As usual they are quoting ""sources"" and a letter sent by some Dy. manager in south central railways proposing this.  End result.......1000s of poor migrant workers in Mumbai flock to Bandra Station because they think the trains have already started, though the ABP news does not say it's started NOW.  Was it really important for ABP News to post such a hurried report in such an irresponsible manner?  I don't know, maybe they will come back and say that the people should have gone beyond headlines and read the full article.  But the fact remains that in today's times, responsible journalism is hard to find.  Disclaimer: No Trains or Buses have started for anyone across India. Migrants are supposed to hold their positions. Govt will take care of you. And listen to only what the STATE LEADERS say themselves, don't fall prey to these idiotic TRP hungry media rumors.  *****  Please revoke their license . They must be punished !!

7896	"On ground level the conditions is very bad. We lost our beloved freedom fighter grandfather ar Sason hospital pune because of missmanagamet and lack of basic care.  Our Freedom fighter Grandfather was admitted at Sason Hospital for Corona Testing ward.   We ourselves lifted him and put him on the Testing ward bed because of no ward boy.  Here lot the beds were kept at a distance of 1 feet only.  There we no masks on suspected patients. Some patients we waiting for test  report from more than 3 days. So if a person is not having corona he will definitely get it from a possitive person coughing.  Our grandfather had phenomia. But as no private hospital was getting him admitted before corona test we had to take him to sason.  His test result came negative. But before test result he lost his precious life.  They had removed his oxygen mask and saline also earlier only because he was moving his hands. They should have done something so atleast oxygen was given to him untill test result came.  There protocal is before corona test result no medicice will be given. This we felt is not right.  We feel People who are very serious should be given proper medicinal attention till the test results come.  Other wise deaths from non corona patients will be more.  Some of the observations we made at Sason hospital corona testing ward.  1. Lots of beds are kept at 30-60cm distance.  2. Many patients are not wearing masks and coughing.  3. Just to take out case paper in order to admit ptient to the testing ward half an hour to 45 minutes waiting time is needed.   Till then our Grandfather was kept in a waiting ward where all corona suspects were standing in front of us. He was not even given basic something to cover himself as he was feeling very cold.  So you better take a pillow and bed sheet with you.  4. Inside the testing ward also the bedsheet of the earlier patient is not removed. So one might very well sleep on the positive patients bedsheet.  5. In the testing wards nurses stand at the door and ask if any one wants food. If your  patient us able to walk well and good. If not you might die of hunger and water. So you better carry food and water and go your self in the testing ward to give it to them in case your patient cant has difficuly in walking.  6. If your patient is not in walking condition and wants to go to toilet. They wont get help from hospital staff. So you have to fight with army at the door of the ward to let you inside to check your patient. Sugeastion: you better take adult daiper for such patients and your self put and remove them.  7. If your patient needs continous attention in case of very serious situation. You will have to stand or sit on your pateints bed 24x7 till result if test come. So in case your patient need help you can tell the doctor.  We have seen all of these. Our Grandfather Freedomfighter Shankarrao Ramchandra Jagdale was a great soul, who did a lot for his country while he was alive and even till his last breadth.  Due to weakness he was not able to talk and move himself at the time of admission on 7th April. Being an Isolation wards we to could not help much.   I think he found himself helpless and dependent at that movement and left this world to serve at Heaven much before we received the Negative report for his Covid19 test. He never wanted to be dependent on anyone and lived his life with Values and Principles. And was doing all his activities independently till 6th April 2020. He always acted like a Warrior in every situation and truly lived his life like a King till his last Breath. As per his mission statement, he left his life for saving the Nation.  He understood that if he is moved to any private hospital after testing negative for Covid19 test this time, still he would carry great chances of affecting others due to the unsafe conditions in the Suspect ward. A great Salute and let’s pay tribute to the Real Freedom Fighter who didn’t only fought before independence but continued his fight till last breath.  I am sure our Nation would not forget the services rendered by this silent ‘Hero’.  He is now settled permanently in our Hearts...  From all Jagdale Family.."

So you better take a pillow and bed sheet with you.  4. Inside the testing ward also the bedsheet of the earlier patient is not removed. So one might very well sleep on the positive patients bedsheet.  5. In the testing wards nurses stand at the door and ask if any one wants food. If your  patient us able to walk well and good. If not you might die of hunger and water. So you better carry food and water and go your self in the testing ward to give it to them in case your patient cant has difficuly in walking.  6. If your patient is not in walking condition and wants to go to toilet. They wont get help from hospital staff. So you have to fight with army at the door of the ward to let you inside to check your patient. Sugeastion: you better take adult daiper for such patients and your self put and remove them.  7. If your patient needs continous attention in case of very serious situation. You will have to stand or sit on your pateints bed 24x7 till result if test come. So in case your patient need help you can tell the doctor.  We have seen all of these. Our Grandfather Freedomfighter Shankarrao Ramchandra Jagdale was a great soul, who did a lot for his country while he was alive and even till his last breadth.  Due to weakness he was not able to talk and move himself at the time of admission on 7th April. Being an Isolation wards we to could not help much.   I think he found himself helpless and dependent at that movement and left this world to serve at Heaven much before we received the Negative report for his Covid19 test. He never wanted to be dependent on anyone and lived his life with Values and Principles. And was doing all his activities independently till 6th April 2020. He always acted like a Warrior in every situation and truly lived his life like a King till his last Breath. As per his mission statement, he left his life for saving the Nation.  He understood that if he is moved to any private hospital after testing negative for Covid19 test this time, still he would carry great chances of affecting others due to the unsafe conditions in the Suspect ward. A great Salute and let’s pay tribute to the Real Freedom Fighter who didn’t only fought before independence but continued his fight till last breath.  I am sure our Nation would not forget the services rendered by this silent ‘Hero’.  He is now settled permanently in our Hearts...  From all Jagdale Family.."
